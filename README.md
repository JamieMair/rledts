# Reinforcement learning for efficient discrete time trajectory sampling (WIP)
 
This repository contains the code used to generate the results found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12890). These include:
- tabular and neural network based approaches to the construction of a dynamics which efficiently generates random walker excursions
- a linear, fourier transform based approach to finding a dynamics for efficient study of rare statistics for currents on a ring with a periodic potential
